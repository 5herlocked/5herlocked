### Hey, Shardul here.

Partner Solutions Architect working in the cloud and AI space, helping teams design systems that actually work at scale. Contributed to several open source projects with a focus on making infrastructure feel invisible when it's done right.

Built the Bedrock integration for Zed IDE from scratch and actively maintains it as the service evolves. Most recently added API key support alongside the existing AWS auth formats because users asked for it.

Outside of work: photography, collecting vinyl for the warmth and nostalgia, and self-hosting infrastructure. There's something satisfying about running your own stack.

Code should be readable. Systems should be maintainable. Everything else is just noise.

### Background

B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia State University with a focus on distributed computing, performance optimization, and edge computing. The death of the Personal Area Network was the saddest thing.
