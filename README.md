Hello, I'm Shardul.

I build things that solve problems, mostly in the cloud and AI space. Currently working as an Partner Solutions Architect, helping teams design systems that actually work at scale. I've contributed to several open source projects and spend time thinking about how infrastructure should feel invisible when it's done right.

I built the Bedrock integration for Zed IDE from scratch and actively maintain it as the service evolves. Most recently added API key support alongside the existing AWS auth formats because users asked for it.

Outside of work, I'm into photography, collecting vinyl for the warmth and nostalgia, and self-hosting my own infrastructure because I like having control over my data. There's something satisfying about running your own stack.

I believe in pushing boundaries and building the future, but also in keeping things simple enough that someone else can understand them six months later. Code should be readable. Systems should be maintainable. Everything else is just noise.

If you want to chat about cloud architecture, AI, or why analog formats still matter in 2025, you can find me at [shardul.me](https://shardul.me).
